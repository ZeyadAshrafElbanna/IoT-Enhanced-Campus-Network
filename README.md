# SmartCampusNet

SmartCampusNet is a network infrastructure project designed to empower educational institutions through a secure and scalable smart campus network. This project showcases a comprehensive university-wide network integrating:

- 🔐 Port Security
- 🌐 VLAN Segmentation
- 🛰️ Static & RIP Routing
- 📡 IoT Components & MQTT Protocol

It simulates the network of a main and branch campus with administrative, academic, and lab buildings connected via a robust static routing setup. Smart devices like smoke detectors, sirens, and smart doors enhance safety and automation across the campus using IoT protocols.

## 🔧 Features

- Logical segmentation of networks via VLANs
- Port security on access switches
- Static and RIP-based routing between buildings
- MQTT-enabled IoT devices for campus automation and safety
- Centralized and branch campus integration
- Network diagram and simulation overview


## 🏫 Network Overview

The network includes:

- **Main Campus**: Admin, HR, BIS, ENG, ART, IT buildings
- **Branch Campus**: Faculty of Medicine
- **IoT Devices**: Smart doors, smoke detectors, sirens
- **MQTT Server**: For IoT communication
- **External Email Server**
- **Static + RIP Routing**: Ensures robust and predictable routing between network segments
